## Steps to Create Your Blog

### **1. Fork the Jekyll Theme**

- Name the repository `<your-username>.github.io` (replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username).
- Click **Create repository**.

---

### **2. Configure Your Repository**
- Open the `_config.yml` file in the repository.
- Edit the following:
  - **URL:**

    ```
  - **Title and Description:**

---

### **3. Enable GitHub Pages**
- Navigate to the **Settings** tab of your repository.

    ```

### **8. Write Your First Blog Post**

  gem install jekyll-livereload
  ```

  group :jekyll_plugins do
    gem 'jekyll-livereload'
  end
  ```

  bundle install
  ```
- Run the server with LiveReload:

  bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
  ```

### **11. Optional: Use a Custom Domain**

- Update the DNS settings:
  - Add `A` records pointing to:
    ```
    185.199.108.153
    185.199.109.153
    185.199.110.153
    185.199.111.153
    ```
